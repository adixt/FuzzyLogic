# FuzzyLogic

It is a type-2 Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System (FIS).
It shows the Transportation Cost (TC) and Bullwhip Indicator (BI) to System Condition (SC) fuzzy rules.
The data used in the simulation is based on the real-world European distribution network from the premium fashion industry.
This project was prepared during the IDS studies from the Lodz University of Technology.

The solution is based on Majid Farzaneh (2021).
